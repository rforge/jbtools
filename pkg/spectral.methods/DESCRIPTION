Description: This package contains some implementations of SSA for the gap filling (gapfillSSA() ) 
 and spectral decomposition (filterTseriesSSA() ) of time series. It uses the SSA algorithm 
 developed by Korobeneykov (2009) and implemented in Rssa which has to be downloaded from Cran or 
 http://github.com/asl/rssa. All code is under constant development and errors or bugs sometimes occour 
 when the functions are used in new contexts and scenarios which have not yet been tested. 
 Please report all such errors to the mailing lists on R-Forge and the author will try to fix them, 
 time permitting.
