Description: Set of tools to simplify the handling of ncdf files with the RNetCDF package. 
 Most functions are wrappers for basic functions from RNetCDF to run combinations of these 
 functions for frequently encountered tasks. A few functions included are very specific
 to the authors research work and may be of limited use to others. All code is under 
 constant development and errors or bugs sometimes occour when the functions are used in 
 new contexts and scenarios which have not yet been tested. Please report all such errors to 
 the mailing lists on R-Forge and the author will try to fix them, time permitting.
